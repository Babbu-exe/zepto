# 🛒 Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Project

I built a complete, real-world Data Analyst portfolio project using an e-commerce inventory dataset based on Zepto, one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce platforms. This project allowed me to work through a practical analyst workflow, from raw data exploration and cleaning to SQL-based business analysis and generating meaningful insights.



This project helped me:

📊 Apply SQL and PostgreSQL to a real-world dataset

🧹 Perform data cleaning and validation

💼 Analyze pricing, discounts, inventory, and product performance

📈 Generate business-focused insights for decision-making

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory **database**

✅ Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement **Data Cleaning** to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write **business-driven SQL queries** to derive insights around **pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue** and more

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset/data?select=zepto_v2.csv) and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

* **sku\_id:** Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)
* **name:** Product name as it appears on the app
* **category:** Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.
* **mrp:** Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)
* **discountPercent:** Discount applied on MRP
* **discountedSellingPrice:** Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)
* **availableQuantity:** Units available in inventory
* **weightInGms:** Product weight in grams
* **outOfStock:** Boolean flag indicating stock availability
* **quantity:** Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

## 🔧 Project Workflow

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

### 1\. Database \& Table Creation

We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku\_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```

### 2\. Data Import

* Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.
* If you're not able to use the import feature, write this code instead:

```sql
   \\copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
  FROM 'data/zepto\_v2.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
```

* Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.

### 3\. 🔍 Data Exploration

* Counted the total number of records in the dataset
* Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content
* Checked for null values across all columns
* Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset
* Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts
* Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs
* Checking invalid pricing present in the data set

### 4\. 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero
* Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability
* checking inventory consistency ,if availableQuantity is more then quantity
* checking if the stock makes sense , product is out of stock and availableQuantity is more then 0

### 5\. 📊 Business Insights

* Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
* Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock
* Estimated potential revenue for each product category
* Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount
* Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts
* Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products
* Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories
* Measured total inventory weight per product category



## 🛠️ How to Use This Project  

1. **Open zepto\_SQL\_data\_analysis.sql**

   This file contains:

   * Table creation
   * Data exploration
   * Data cleaning
   * SQL Business analysis

**2. Load the dataset into pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client**

* Create a database and run the SQL file
* Import the dataset (convert to UTF-8 if necessary)
